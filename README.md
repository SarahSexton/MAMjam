# Voxelles' Mother Arcade Machine (MAM) Jam, 2016
The "Voxelles: Chicago's Women in Game Development" organization
led a two-day Game Jam to foster new friendships, 
increase technical knowledge, and highlight opportunities in the community. <br>
**Who attended:** 11 people, 100% female attendance <br>
**When:** April 30 - May 1, 2016 <br>
**Description:** This event stimulated collaboration and combined
all talents into one team to create a single game, designed for an 
arcade cabinet. People of all backgrounds were encouraged to participate 
and contribute to the spread of game development and creativity. 
The theme of this game jam was loosely based on Motherhood and building 
female-friendly games. Microsoft sponsored and provided the catering of 
breakfast, snacks, and dinner.
