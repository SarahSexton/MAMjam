# Voxelles' Mother Arcade Machine (MAM) Jam, 2016
The "Voxelles: Chicago's Women in Game Development" organization
led a two-day Game Jam to foster new friendships, 
increase technical knowledge, and highlight opportunities in the community. <br>
**Who attended:** 11 people, 100% female attendance <br>
**When:** April 30 - May 1, 2016 <br>
**Description:** This event stimulated collaboration and combined
all talents into one team to create a single game, designed for an 
arcade cabinet. People of all backgrounds were encouraged to participate 
and contribute to the spread of game development and creativity. 
The theme of this game jam was loosely based on Motherhood and building 
female-friendly games. Microsoft sponsored and provided the catering of 
breakfast, snacks, and dinner.

#Insights 
Something learned during the event: 
* "For this event, it was important to know participants'
 skills and program knowledge. Things rolled in our favor 
 when we got a good mix of programing, development, and 
 creative ability."
* "The effort required to coordinate art and the 
complexity behind a game that could take all of five minutes 
but still has multiple endings. Also an appreciation for 
a good sound person."
* "I got a sense of what it's like to work in a team, sharing
 assets, etc. I also learned specific things like exporting
  Unity packages and those label gizmos."
* "I had a lot of fun. I’m going to figure out how to integrate
 the audio I created into Unity."
* "I thought the Jam went pretty well, which is why I want to see 
the game through to completion. I think maybe we spent too long planning."
 

Wish we knew beforehand: 
* "I wish I had more understanding for timing and guidelines 
 to a base start, and then building up from there."
* "I wish we’d all had a chance to talk about our 
 experiences going to games. Like tips for how to handle certain situations."
* "I'm not sure we realized just how much time we needed to allocate to tying up all the loose ends."
